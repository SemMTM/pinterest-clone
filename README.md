# Pinterest95
Pinterest95 is the first ever version of the now well known social media platform Pinterest. Designed during the days of windows 95, it has a very famililar style and many great features! Pinterest95 is a social media platform that allows users to discover new inspiration for anything and everthing. It is an image sharing platform that allows users to create image/mood boards of posts they like, imteract with images an share posts of their own. 

To use the features of Pinterest95 a user must create and account on log in. Afterwards a user will then be able to:

- Create/Delete posts
- Comment/Like posts
- Create/Edit/Delete image boards
- Save images to image boards

and many other interactive features.

This is a Django-basedd website with all CRUD functionality, agile methodologies were used to plan and implement all features.

The deployed site can be found [HERE](https://pinterest-clone-sem-29d41bc2ed17.herokuapp.com)
